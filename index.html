      <h2>Hello!</h2>
      <p class="intro"> I am a student at the University of Texas at Dallas with a major in Information Technology & Systems.</p>

      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <div class="about-me">
        <p>I’m a third-year undergraduate student pursuing a BA in Information Technology and Systems with a fast track in MS in Business Analytics. My past experiences have been actively learning many programming languages.</p>
        <p>Along with programming, I am a full-time student, and I virtually tutor elementary math to students who are in need of help. Before COVID -19, I volunteered at the Tarrant County Foodbank on the weekends where I assisted with the process
          of
          organizing and preparing canned goods and other products to be sent to families in need.</p>
        <p>In my college experience, I have collaborated with other students in many group projects, which has taught me how to be a team player, a problem-solver, and to have great communication with each other. Additionally, I have 3 years of
          customer
          service in my previous employments and I am able to adapt to new working environments and systems quickly.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I am currently seeking for Information Technology or Data Science opportunities in the DFW area. I am looking forward to work with a company that can help me grow professionally and emphasizes teamwork. I am a passionate learner
          who
          always seeks learning opportunities and gain professional experience.</p>
