        <h2>Why Programming?</h2>
        <p>Ever since I was younger, I always had a passion with computers and other pieces of technology.
        That was when I realized that I want to work with computers and technology for a living.
        It became my passion to learn more about it. Last but not least, I also want to contribute to the evolving technology.</p>

        <h2>My Career Goals</h2>
        <p>A long term goal of mine is to be the person that my company goes to when they need to get something right.
          A short - term career goal of mine is to gain experience in leadership and team – building.
          Although, I have learned a set of team - building skills in school, I want to improve on areas to team build in an industry. Whether that is having better communication or if it’s talking and accepting differences. </p>

          <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
